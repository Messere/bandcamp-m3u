# Bandcamp M3U

Userscript which allows to generate and download M3U playlist from
any Bandcamp album.

Instead of listening in a clumsy web page player, download the playlist and
stream the music in your favourite music software (assuming it supports
m3u playlists and http streaming).

## Installation

Make sure you have [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

on how to import script (for Tampermonkey it will be as easy as opening the control
